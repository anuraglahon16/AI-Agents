# 4.1 Infrastructure Requirements

Deploying AI agents to production requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements. Unlike traditional software applications, AI agents have unique needs related to model serving, scalability, and resource management. This section explores the infrastructure components necessary for successful AI agent deployment, from basic requirements to advanced configurations.

## Compute Resources

### Overview

AI agents, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs), have significant compute requirements. The specific needs vary based on deployment approach, model size, and expected load, but understanding these requirements is essential for successful production deployment.

### CPU vs. GPU Requirements

1. **CPU-Based Deployments**
   - Suitable for inference with smaller models
   - Lower cost but higher latency
   - Good for lower-traffic applications
   - Example: Deploying a fine-tuned BERT model for classification tasks might work well on CPU-only infrastructure

2. **GPU-Based Deployments**
   - Essential for larger models (most modern LLMs)
   - Significantly faster inference
   - Higher cost but better user experience
   - Example: Deploying GPT-4 or similar models typically requires GPU acceleration to maintain reasonable response times

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - CPU for orchestration and tool execution
   - GPU for model inference
   - Optimized resource allocation
   - Example: Using CPUs to handle API calls, data processing, and business logic while reserving GPUs exclusively for LLM inference

4. **Sizing Considerations**
   - Model size and quantization level
   - Expected request volume
   - Latency requirements
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Example: A model quantized to 8-bit precision requires less GPU memory than its 16-bit or 32-bit counterparts, potentially allowing deployment on less expensive hardware

### Memory Requirements

1. **RAM Considerations**
   - System memory for application processes
   - Context window management
   - Data processing and caching
   - Example: An agent that processes large documents might need substantial RAM for document handling, separate from the memory needed for the model itself

2. **GPU Memory**
   - Model weight storage
   - Inference processing
   - Batch size limitations
   - Example: A 7B parameter model in half precision (FP16) requires approximately 14GB of GPU memory just for the model weights, with additional memory needed for inference operations

3. **Storage Requirements**
   - Model weight persistence
   - Vector database storage
   - Log and telemetry data
   - Example: A production RAG system might need terabytes of storage for document embeddings in a vector database, plus additional storage for the original documents

4. **Memory Optimization Techniques**
   - Model quantization
   - Efficient attention mechanisms
   - Gradient checkpointing
   - Example: Quantizing a model from FP16 to INT8 can reduce memory requirements by nearly 50% with minimal impact on performance for many use cases

### Scaling Units

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Increasing resources on individual machines
   - Limits based on available hardware
   - Simpler architecture but limited ceiling
   - Example: Upgrading from an NVIDIA A10 GPU to an A100 GPU to handle increased load without changing the deployment architecture

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Adding more machines to the deployment
   - Load balancing across instances
   - Higher theoretical scaling ceiling
   - Example: Deploying multiple identical agent instances behind a load balancer to distribute user requests

3. **Hybrid Scaling Strategies**
   - Optimizing individual nodes
   - Scaling out when vertical limits reached
   - Cost-performance optimization
   - Example: First maximizing the capabilities of each server with optimal GPU configurations, then adding more servers when performance requirements exceed what a single server can provide

4. **Scaling Unit Economics**
   - Cost per inference
   - Cost per user
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Example: Calculating the infrastructure cost per 1000 agent interactions to determine pricing and optimization priorities
