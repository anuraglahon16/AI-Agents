# AI Agent Fundamentals - AWS Research Notes

## Definition of AI Agents

An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals.

For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolve customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human.

## Key Principles that Define AI Agents

All software autonomously completes different tasks as determined by the software developer. What makes AI or intelligent agents special?

AI agents are rational agents. They make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. An AI agent senses its environment with physical or software interfaces.

For example, a robotic agent collects sensor data, and a chatbot uses customer queries as input. Then, the AI agent applies the data to make an informed decision. It analyzes the collected data to predict the best outcomes that support predetermined goals. The agent also uses the results to formulate the next action that it should take. For example, self-driving cars navigate around obstacles on the road based on data from multiple sensors.

## Types of AI Agents

Organizations create and deploy different types of intelligent agents:

### Simple reflex agents

A simple reflex agent operates strictly based on predefined rules and its immediate data. It will not respond to situations beyond a given event condition action rule. Hence, these agents are suitable for simple tasks that don't require extensive training. For example, you can use a simple reflex agent to reset passwords by detecting specific keywords in a user's conversation.

### Model-based reflex agents

A model-based agent is similar to simple reflex agents, except the former has a more advanced decision-making mechanism. Rather than merely following a specific rule, a model-based agent evaluates probable outcomes and consequences before deciding. Using supporting data, it builds an internal model of the world it perceives and uses that to support its decisions.

### Goal-based agents

Goal-based agents, or rule-based agents, are AI agents with more robust reasoning capabilities. Besides evaluating the environment data, the agent compares different approaches to help it achieve the desired outcome. Goal-based agents always choose the most efficient path. They are suitable for performing complex tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP) and robotics applications.

### Utility-based agents

A utility-based agent uses a complex reasoning algorithm to help users maximize the outcome they desire. The agent compares different scenarios and their respective utility values or benefits. Then, it chooses one that provides users with the most rewards. For example, customers can use a utility-based agent to search for flight tickets with minimum traveling time, irrespective of the price.

### Learning agents

A learning agent continuously learns from previous experiences to improve its results. Using sensory input and feedback mechanisms, the agent adapts its learning element over time to meet specific standards. On top of that, it uses a problem generator to design new tasks to train itself from collected data and past results.

### Hierarchical agents

Hierarchical agents are an organized group of intelligent agents arranged in tiers. The higher-level agents deconstruct complex tasks into smaller ones and assign them to lower-level agents. Each agent runs independently and submits a progress report to its supervising agent. The higher-level agent collects the results and coordinates subordinate agents to ensure they collectively achieve goals.

## Benefits of Using AI Agents

AI agents can improve your business operations and your customer experience.

### Improved productivity

AI agents are autonomous intelligent systems performing specific tasks without human intervention. Organizations use them to achieve specific goals and more efficient business outcomes. Business teams are more productive when they delegate repetitive tasks to AI agents. This way, they can divert their attention to mission-critical or creative activities, adding more value to their organization.

## Key Components of AI Agent Architecture

AI agents have several components that enable them to perceive, reason, and act in their environment:

### Sensors

Sensors are the components that allow AI agents to perceive their environment. They collect data from various sources, such as cameras, microphones, or databases. For example, a chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries, while a robotic agent uses cameras and other sensors to perceive its physical environment.

### Reasoning engine

The reasoning engine is the brain of the AI agent. It processes the data collected by the sensors and makes decisions based on that data. The reasoning engine uses various algorithms, such as rule-based systems, machine learning models, or deep learning networks, to analyze the data and determine the best course of action.

### Actuators

Actuators are the components that allow AI agents to act in their environment. They execute the decisions made by the reasoning engine. For example, a chatbot uses natural language generation to respond to user queries, while a robotic agent uses motors and other mechanical components to move and manipulate objects.

### Knowledge base

The knowledge base is the repository of information that the AI agent uses to make decisions. It includes facts, rules, and other information that the agent has learned or been programmed with. The knowledge base can be static, meaning it doesn't change over time, or dynamic, meaning it updates as the agent learns from its experiences.

### Learning component

The learning component allows the AI agent to improve its performance over time. It updates the agent's knowledge base and reasoning engine based on the agent's experiences. For example, a chatbot might learn from past conversations to improve its responses, while a robotic agent might learn from past movements to improve its navigation.

## How AI Agents Work

AI agents follow a specific workflow to achieve their goals:

1. **Perception**: The agent perceives its environment through sensors, collecting data that it will use to make decisions.

2. **Reasoning**: The agent processes the collected data using its reasoning engine and knowledge base to determine the best course of action.

3. **Action**: The agent executes the chosen action through its actuators, affecting its environment in some way.

4. **Learning**: The agent learns from the results of its actions, updating its knowledge base and reasoning engine to improve its future performance.

This cycle repeats as the agent continues to interact with its environment, allowing it to adapt and improve over time.

## Challenges of Using AI Agents

Despite their benefits, AI agents also present several challenges:

### Complexity

AI agents can be complex to design and implement, requiring expertise in various fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and domain-specific knowledge.

### Data quality

AI agents rely on high-quality data to make accurate decisions. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect decisions and actions.

### Ethical considerations

AI agents raise ethical concerns related to privacy, security, and accountability. For example, an AI agent that makes decisions affecting people's lives should be transparent and fair.

### Integration

Integrating AI agents with existing systems and processes can be challenging, requiring careful planning and implementation.

### Maintenance

AI agents require ongoing maintenance to ensure they continue to perform effectively. This includes updating their knowledge base, refining their reasoning engine, and adapting to changes in their environment.
