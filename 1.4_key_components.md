# 1.4 Key Components of AI Agent Architecture

AI agents are complex systems composed of several interconnected components that work together to enable perception, reasoning, and action. Understanding these key architectural components is essential for designing effective AI agents that can successfully operate in their intended environments. This section explores the fundamental building blocks of AI agent architecture.

## Sensors (Perception)

### Overview

Sensors are the components that allow AI agents to perceive and gather information from their environment. They serve as the agent's "eyes and ears," providing the raw data that the agent will process to understand its surroundings and make decisions.

   - Proximity sensors

2. **Digital Sensors**: For software agents
   - API connections
   - Database queries
   - Web scrapers
   - User input interfaces
   - File system monitors
   - Network traffic analyzers
   - Event listeners

### Functions
