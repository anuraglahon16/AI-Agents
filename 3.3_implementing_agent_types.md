# 3.3 Implementing Different Agent Types

Implementing different types of AI agents requires understanding their unique architectures, capabilities, and use cases. This section explores practical implementation approaches for various agent types, from simple task-specific agents to sophisticated autonomous systems, providing code examples and best practices for each.

## Simple Task-Specific Agents

### Overview

Simple task-specific agents are designed to excel at a single well-defined task or narrow domain. These agents have focused capabilities, straightforward implementation, and clear performance metrics, making them excellent starting points for agent development.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Task Definition and Scoping**
   - Clearly defined input and output specifications
   - Explicit task boundaries
   - Specific success criteria
   - Example: A product recommendation agent that takes user preferences and returns relevant product suggestions

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Task-specific instructions
   - Few-shot examples for consistent formatting
   - Constraint specification
   - Example: A prompt template that defines exactly how product recommendations should be formatted and what information to include

3. **Minimal Tool Integration**
   - Only essential tools for the specific task
   - Simple tool interfaces
   - Clear usage patterns
   - Example: Integrating only a product database search tool without unnecessary capabilities

4. **Direct Execution Flow**
   - Linear processing pipeline
   - Minimal branching logic
   - Predictable operation
   - Example: A straightforward process of understanding the query, searching the database, and formatting recommendations

### Implementation Example

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Define the product search tool
def search_products(query):
    """Search for products matching the query in our database."""
    # In a real implementation, this would query a product database
    # For this example, we'll return mock data
    return [
        {"id": "P123", "name": "Ergonomic Office Chair", "price": 299.99, "rating": 4.7},
        {"id": "P456", "name": "Adjustable Standing Desk", "price": 449.99, "rating": 4.8},
        {"id": "P789", "name": "Laptop Stand", "price": 79.99, "rating": 4.5}
    ]

# Create the tool
product_search_tool = Tool(
    name="ProductSearch",
    func=search_products,
    description="Searches for products matching the user's requirements"
)

# Define the recommendation prompt
recommendation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query", "products"],
    template="""
You are a helpful product recommendation assistant.
Based on the user's query: "{query}"
And these available products: {products}

Recommend the most suitable products. For each recommendation, include:
1. Product name
2. Price
3. Why it matches their needs
4. A brief suggestion for how they might use it

Format your response as a clean list of recommendations.
"""
)

# Create the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2)

# Create the recommendation chain
recommendation_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=recommendation_prompt
)

# Simple task-specific agent function
def product_recommendation_agent(user_query):
    # Search for relevant products
    products = product_search_tool.run(user_query)
    
    # Generate recommendations
    response = recommendation_chain.run(
        query=user_query,
        products=products
    )
    
    return response

# Example usage
user_query = "I need furniture for my home office that will help with back pain."
recommendations = product_recommendation_agent(user_query)
print(recommendations)
```

### Best Practices

1. **Focused Scope**
   - Resist feature creep
   - Excel at one thing rather than being mediocre at many
   - Clear documentation of capabilities and limitations
   - Example: A product recommendation agent that doesn't try to also handle customer service, technical support, or order processing

2. **Robust Input Handling**
   - Validation of user inputs
   - Graceful handling of edge cases
   - Clear error messages
   - Example: Properly handling queries with spelling errors, vague requirements, or missing information

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient prompt design
   - Minimal token usage
   - Caching for repeated queries
   - Example: Caching product search results for similar queries to reduce database load and improve response time

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Collecting usage data
   - Analyzing failure cases
   - Iterative refinement
   - Example: Tracking which recommendations users engage with to improve future recommendation quality

## Conversational Agents

### Overview

Conversational agents engage in natural, multi-turn dialogues with users, maintaining context across interactions and providing helpful responses in a conversational format. These agents require more sophisticated memory management and dialogue handling than simple task-specific agents.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Conversation Management**
   - Tracking conversation history
   - Maintaining context across turns
   - Managing conversation flow
   - Example: A customer service agent that remembers previous questions and answers within the same conversation

2. **Memory Architecture**
   - Short-term conversation buffer
   - Long-term user preferences
   - Selective memory retention
   - Example: Storing recent messages in a conversation buffer while maintaining persistent user preferences in a separate storage

3. **Dialogue Handling**
   - Understanding conversational intents
   - Natural response generation
   - Appropriate follow-up questions
   - Example: Recognizing when a user is asking for clarification versus providing new information

4. **Personality and Tone**
   - Consistent communication style
   - Appropriate formality level
   - Brand alignment
   - Example: Maintaining a friendly, helpful tone that matches the company's brand voice

### Implementation Example

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the conversation prompt
conversation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input"],
    template="""
You are TechHelper, a friendly and knowledgeable technical support assistant for CloudCompute services.

Your personality is: Patient, clear, and slightly enthusiastic about technology. You use simple explanations
without being condescending. You occasionally use light humor when appropriate.

Current conversation:
{history}

User: {input}
TechHelper:"""
)

# Create memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)

# Create LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create conversation chain
conversation_agent = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=conversation_prompt,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Function to handle user interactions
def handle_user_message(user_message):
    response = conversation_agent.predict(input=user_message)
    return response

# Example conversation
responses = []
user_messages = [
    "Hi, I'm having trouble connecting to my cloud instance.",
    "I'm using the standard SSH connection method.",
    "Yes, I've checked that the security group allows SSH traffic.",
    "Oh wait, I just realized my IP address changed. Let me update the security group."
]

for message in user_messages:
    response = handle_user_message(message)
    responses.append(response)
    print(f"User: {message}")
    print(f"TechHelper: {response}\n")
```

### Advanced Features

1. **Intent Recognition**
   - Identifying user goals
   - Detecting question types
   - Recognizing emotional states
   - Example: Distinguishing between a user asking for information, requesting an action, or expressing frustration

2. **Context-Aware Responses**
   - Adapting to conversation history
   - Referencing previous interactions
   - Maintaining thematic coherence
   - Example: "As we discussed earlier about your cloud storage needs..." when continuing a previous topic

3. **Proactive Suggestions**
   - Anticipating user needs
   - Offering relevant information
   - Suggesting next steps
   - Example: "Would you like me to show you how to set up automatic backups for your instance?" after helping with instance setup

4. **Graceful Topic Transitions**
   - Recognizing topic shifts
   - Acknowledging changes
   - Maintaining conversation flow
   - Example: "I see we're shifting from discussing storage options to security concerns. Let me address your question about encryption..."

### Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Summarizing long conversations
   - Prioritizing relevant information
   - Forgetting irrelevant details
   - Example: Condensing a lengthy troubleshooting conversation into key points when the context window fills up

2. **Conversation Boundaries**
   - Clear capabilities communication
   - Appropriate handoff to humans
   - Expectation management
   - Example: "That question requires accessing your account details, which I don't have permission to do. Would you like me to connect you with a support representative?"

3. **Personalization Balance**
   - Appropriate use of user information
   - Avoiding excessive familiarity
   - Respecting privacy
   - Example: Remembering a user's technical expertise level without making assumptions about personal preferences

4. **Conversation Testing**
   - Simulating diverse conversation paths
   - Testing edge cases and recovery
   - Evaluating conversation quality
   - Example: Testing how the agent handles interruptions, topic changes, and ambiguous questions

## Autonomous Agents

### Overview

Autonomous agents operate with minimal human supervision, making independent decisions to achieve defined goals. These agents combine planning capabilities, tool usage, and self-evaluation to perform complex tasks over extended periods, requiring sophisticated architectures and careful implementation.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Goal-Driven Architecture**
   - Clear objective specification
   - Progress tracking mechanisms
   - Success criteria definition
   - Example: A research agent with the goal of creating a comprehensive report on a specific topic

2. **Planning and Execution Loops**
   - Task decomposition
   - Sequential plan generation
   - Execution monitoring
   - Plan adaptation
   - Example: Breaking down "create market analysis" into research, analysis, and report generation phases, then executing each phase while monitoring progress

3. **Tool Integration Framework**
   - Diverse tool selection
   - Dynamic tool choice
   - Result interpretation
   - Example: Choosing between web search, database queries, or calculations based on the current subtask requirements

4. **Self-Evaluation Mechanisms**
   - Output quality assessment
   - Progress evaluation
   - Error detection and recovery
   - Example: Reviewing generated content for accuracy and completeness before proceeding to the next task

    ),
    Tool(
        name="Wikipedia",
        func=wikipedia.run,
        description="Useful for getting detailed background information on a topic."
    )
]

# Create self-evaluation chain
evaluation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["content", "criteria"],
    template="""
Evaluate the following content based on these criteria: {criteria}

CONTENT:
{content}

Provide a detailed evaluation addressing each criterion. Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-10.
Identify specific improvements needed. If the score for any criterion is below 7, 
the content should be revised.
