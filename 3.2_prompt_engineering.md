# 3.2 Prompt Engineering for Agents

Prompt engineering is a critical skill for developing effective AI agents, as it shapes how agents understand tasks, reason through problems, and generate responses. Well-crafted prompts serve as the interface between human intentions and AI capabilities, enabling agents to perform complex tasks reliably. This section explores advanced prompt engineering techniques specifically tailored for agent development.

## System Prompts for Agent Behavior

### Overview

System prompts define an agent's core identity, capabilities, constraints, and behavioral patterns. They establish the foundation for how an agent will approach all interactions and tasks, making them one of the most important elements in agent design.

### Components of Effective System Prompts

1. **Role Definition**
   - Clear identity statement
   - Purpose and specialization
   - Expertise boundaries
   - Example: "You are a financial advisory agent specialized in retirement planning. You have expertise in investment strategies, tax considerations, and long-term financial planning for individuals approaching retirement."

2. **Behavioral Guidelines**
   - Tone and communication style
   - Interaction patterns
   - Response formatting preferences
   - Example: "Communicate in a professional but approachable manner. Avoid financial jargon when possible, but explain necessary technical terms. Structure complex recommendations in numbered steps for clarity."

3. **Ethical Constraints**
   - Explicit boundaries
   - Safety guardrails
   - Responsibility frameworks
   - Example: "Never provide specific investment recommendations for individual securities. Always emphasize the importance of diversification and risk management. Disclose that your advice is informational and not a substitute for a certified financial advisor."

4. **Capability Framing**
   - Available tools and their purposes
   - Knowledge domains and limitations
   - Decision-making authority
   - Example: "You can access current market data, tax regulations, and retirement planning calculators. You cannot access individual user accounts or execute transactions. Direct users to appropriate human representatives for account-specific actions."

### Techniques for System Prompt Design

1. **Persona-Based Engineering**
   - Creating detailed agent personas
   - Defining background and expertise
   - Establishing consistent viewpoints
   - Example: Developing a detailed backstory for a customer service agent as "an experienced customer support specialist with 10 years of experience helping customers resolve technical issues"

2. **Capability Layering**
   - Building prompts in distinct functional layers
   - Separating core identity from specific capabilities
   - Modular prompt construction
   - Example:
     ```
     Layer 1: Core identity as a helpful assistant
     Layer 2: Domain expertise in financial planning
     Layer 3: Specific capabilities for retirement analysis
     Layer 4: Tool usage instructions for calculators and data retrieval
     ```

3. **Constraint Hierarchies**
   - Organizing constraints by priority
   - Establishing decision-making frameworks
   - Creating clear override conditions
   - Example: "Your primary constraint is user safety, followed by accuracy of information, then user satisfaction. Never compromise safety to increase satisfaction."

4. **Metacognitive Framing**
   - Instructions for how the agent should think
   - Problem-solving approaches
   - Self-monitoring guidelines
   - Example: "Approach complex questions by first breaking them down into component parts. Identify what information you need before providing answers. Recognize and acknowledge the limitations of your knowledge."

### Implementation Examples

**Basic System Prompt:**
```
You are a customer service agent for TechCorp, a company that sells electronics. 
You help customers with product information, troubleshooting, and order status.
Be polite and helpful at all times.
```

**Advanced System Prompt:**
```

```

### Evaluation and Iteration

1. **Behavioral Testing**
   - Challenging the agent with diverse scenarios
   - Testing edge cases and unusual requests
   - Evaluating consistency across interactions
   - Example: Testing how the agent responds to ambiguous requests, emotional customers, or questions at the boundary of its expertise

2. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Testing alternative system prompt versions
   - Measuring performance differences
   - Identifying optimal formulations
   - Example: A/B testing different constraint phrasings to see which leads to more consistent adherence

3. **User Feedback Integration**

   - Targeted refinement based on real usage
   - Example: Noticing that users frequently misunderstand the agent's capabilities and adjusting the system prompt to set clearer expectations

4. **Prompt Versioning**
   - Maintaining prompt history
   - Documenting changes and rationales
   - Controlled deployment of updates
   - Example: Implementing a version control system for prompts with clear documentation of what changed and why

## Task Decomposition Prompts

### Overview

Task decomposition prompts enable agents to break complex problems into manageable steps, creating a structured approach to problem-solving. These prompts are essential for agents that need to handle multi-step tasks that require planning and sequential execution.

### Decomposition Strategies

1. **Sequential Decomposition**
   - Breaking tasks into ordered steps
   - Establishing dependencies between steps
   - Creating linear workflows
   - Example: Decomposing "plan a vacation" into steps like budget determination, destination research, transportation booking, accommodation selection, and activity planning

2. **Hierarchical Decomposition**
   - Creating multi-level task breakdowns
   - Organizing subtasks into categories
   - Supporting nested complexity
   - Example: Breaking down "launch a new product" into major phases (research, development, marketing, sales), each with their own subtasks

3. **Functional Decomposition**
   - Dividing by different types of operations
   - Separating research, analysis, and execution
   - Organizing by capability requirements
   - Example: Splitting "write a research report" into information gathering, data analysis, content creation, and formatting tasks

4. **Iterative Decomposition**
   - Starting with high-level breakdown
   - Progressively refining steps as needed
   - Adapting decomposition based on findings
   - Example: Beginning with a rough outline of a data analysis task, then refining specific analysis steps based on initial data exploration

### Prompt Techniques

1. **Explicit Planning Instructions**
   - Direct instructions to plan before acting
   - Guidance on planning approaches
   - Requirements for plan documentation
   - Example: "Before answering the user's question, create a step-by-step plan for how you will approach this problem. List the steps you'll take and what information you'll need at each step."

2. **Decomposition Templates**
   - Structured formats for breaking down tasks
   - Consistent organization patterns
   - Clear step identification
   - Example:
     ```
     To solve this problem:
     1. First, I will... [purpose of this step]
     2. Next, I will... [purpose of this step]
     3. Then, I will... [purpose of this step]
     4. Finally, I will... [purpose of this step]
     ```

3. **Question-Based Decomposition**
   - Using questions to guide breakdown
   - Identifying key considerations
   - Ensuring comprehensive coverage
   - Example: "To plan this project, answer: What is the goal? What resources are needed? What are potential obstacles? What are the critical milestones? What dependencies exist between tasks?"

4. **Metacognitive Prompting**
   - Instructions for thinking about the decomposition process
   - Encouraging evaluation of the breakdown
   - Promoting refinement and adjustment
   - Example: "After creating your initial plan, review it critically. Are there steps that could be broken down further? Are there dependencies you missed? Revise your plan accordingly."

### Implementation Examples

**Basic Decomposition Prompt:**
```
Break down the task of creating a marketing campaign into steps before you begin.
```

**Advanced Decomposition Prompt:**
```
# TASK DECOMPOSITION FRAMEWORK

When approaching complex tasks, follow this structured decomposition process:

## INITIAL ASSESSMENT
- Identify the core objective and desired outcome
- Determine available resources and constraints
- Establish success criteria and evaluation metrics
- Consider potential challenges and dependencies

## HIERARCHICAL BREAKDOWN
- Divide the main task into 3-7 major phases or components
- For each major component, identify 2-5 specific subtasks
- Ensure each subtask is concrete and actionable
- Identify any prerequisites or dependencies between subtasks

## RESOURCE ALLOCATION
- Determine what information is needed for each subtask
- Identify which tools or capabilities are required
- Estimate relative effort or complexity for each component
- Flag subtasks that may require additional expertise or verification

## SEQUENCING AND PRIORITIZATION
- Arrange subtasks in logical execution order
- Identify critical path items that must be completed first
- Group tasks that can be performed in parallel
- Prioritize based on importance, urgency, and dependencies

## VALIDATION AND REFINEMENT
- Review the decomposition for completeness
- Identify potential gaps or overlooked aspects
- Adjust granularity (break down further or consolidate as needed)
- Verify alignment with the original objective

Present your decomposition in a clear, structured format with numbered main components and lettered subtasks. Include brief explanations of why each component is necessary.
```

   - Example: Decomposing a product selection decision into requirements definition, option identification, comparison across key factors, and final evaluation

## Reasoning and Reflection Prompts

### Overview

Reasoning and reflection prompts enhance an agent's ability to think critically, consider multiple perspectives, evaluate its own thinking, and improve its responses. These prompts are crucial for complex tasks that require sophisticated reasoning rather than simple information retrieval or generation.

### Reasoning Enhancement Techniques

1. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
   - Explicit instructions to show reasoning steps
   - Encouraging logical progression
   - Making implicit thinking explicit
   - Example: "Think step by step to solve this problem. Show your reasoning for each step, including any assumptions you make and how you arrive at intermediate conclusions."

2. **Tree of Thoughts**
   - Exploring multiple reasoning paths
   - Evaluating different approaches
   - Selecting optimal solution paths
   - Example: "Consider three different approaches to solving this problem. For each approach, think through the first few steps and evaluate its potential. Then select the most promising approach and develop it fully."

3. **Socratic Questioning**
   - Self-questioning to deepen analysis
   - Challenging assumptions
   - Exploring implications
   - Example: "As you develop your response, ask yourself: What assumptions am I making? What evidence supports my conclusions? What alternative explanations exist? What are the implications of this reasoning?"

4. **Analogical Reasoning**
   - Using analogies to approach problems
   - Transferring solutions between domains
   - Leveraging familiar patterns
   - Example: "Consider if there's a similar problem you know how to solve. How is this problem similar or different? Can you adapt the solution approach from the familiar problem?"

### Reflection Techniques

1. **Self-Evaluation Prompts**
   - Instructions to assess response quality
   - Specific evaluation criteria
   - Improvement identification
   - Example: "After drafting your response, evaluate it against these criteria: accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance. Identify at least one way to improve in each area."

2. **Counterfactual Thinking**
   - Considering alternative scenarios
   - Exploring different conditions
   - Testing robustness of conclusions
   - Example: "After reaching your conclusion, consider: What would change if [key assumption] were different? Would your recommendation still be valid? What's the threshold at which your advice would change?"

3. **Perspective Taking**
   - Viewing problems from multiple viewpoints
   - Considering different stakeholders
   - Addressing diverse concerns
   - Example: "Co
